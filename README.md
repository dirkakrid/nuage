# nuage
Nuage (french for cloud) is a port of the Arduino bridge library to Debian (mainly targetted at Raspbian). It should also work on Banana Pi and other single board computers. The primarily supported controller is ATmega328 (16MHz, 5V) as found on Watterotts RPi Shield bridge. ATmega328 on breadboard (3,3V, 8MHz internal) is supported as well. ATmega2560, ATmega32u4 and some ATtinys will follow as well.

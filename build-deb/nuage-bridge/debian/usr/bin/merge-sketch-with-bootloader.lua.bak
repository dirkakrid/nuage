FIXME: Concatenation of bootloader and sketches is necessary 
when using an ATmega32u4 or similar where no upload via UART 
is possible and upload has to take place using SPI. The 328P
allows upload via UART. Thus we use it. So to enhance com-
patibility change this script to detect the ÂµC used and then.
act accordingly.
